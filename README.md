# Wifi-Car
This code is for controlling a device using a web server hosted on an ESP8266 module. It connects to a WiFi network, listens for incoming data from clients (presumably a web browser), and performs actions based on the received commands. Here's a brief overview:<br>

<br>
The ESP8266 module connects to a WiFi network using provided credentials.<br>
It sets up a web server on port 80 to handle incoming client requests.<br>
Depending on the received data from the client, it performs various actions, such as turning on/off LEDs connected to GPIO pins (D0-D6).<br>
The client can send commands like "F" for forward, "B" for back, "L" for left, "R" for right, and others to control the device.<br>
The getclientdata function reads the incoming data from the client, parses it, and returns the relevant portion of the data to be used for decision-making.<br>
The code includes comments to explain each section's purpose and functionality.<br>
<br>

This project demonstrates IoT (Internet of Things) principles, allowing remote control of devices over a network. It's a practical example of using ESP8266 modules for home automation or similar applications.
